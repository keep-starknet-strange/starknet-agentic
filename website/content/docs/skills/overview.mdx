# Skills Overview

Skills are **reusable capability packages** that extend what AI agents can do on Starknet. Each skill provides a focused set of tools, code examples, and documentation for a specific domain.

## What are Skills?

A skill is a self-contained package defined by a `SKILL.md` file with:

- **YAML Frontmatter** - Metadata like name, description, and keywords
- **Documentation** - Detailed guides and code examples
- **Prerequisites** - Required packages and environment variables
- **Reference Scripts** - Working code snippets agents can use

<Callout type="info" title="Skill Format">
Skills follow the [AgentSkills specification](/docs/skills/writing-skills) - a standard format for defining AI agent capabilities that works across different frameworks and models.
</Callout>

## Available Skills

Starknet Agentic provides five official skills. Use the search and filter controls to explore:

## Installing Skills

Skills are designed to be loaded by AI agents at runtime. The agent reads the skill documentation and uses the provided code patterns to accomplish tasks.

### For Claude Code / Cursor

Add skills to your project by referencing them in your configuration:

```bash
# Clone the skills into your project
git clone https://github.com/starkware/starknet-agentic
cp -r starknet-agentic/skills ./skills
```

The agent will automatically discover skills in the `skills/` directory.

### For MCP Server Users

The MCP server provides tools that implement skill functionality directly. See the [MCP Server Guide](/docs/guides/mcp-server) for setup.

### Using ClawHub

Browse and install community skills from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com):

```bash
# Install a skill from ClawHub (coming soon)
claw install starknet-wallet
```

## Skill File Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```text
skills/
|
+-- starknet-wallet/
    |-- SKILL.md          # Skill definition (required)
    |-- package.json      # Dependencies (optional)
    |-- scripts/          # Reference implementations
    |   |-- check-balance.ts
    |   +-- transfer.ts
    +-- .env.example      # Environment template
```

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill has a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: starknet-wallet
description: >
  Create and manage Starknet wallets for AI agents.
  Transfer tokens, check balances, and more.
keywords:
  - starknet
  - wallet
  - transfer
  - balance
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - Write
user-invocable: true
---

# Starknet Wallet Skill

```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphenated identifier (1-64 chars) |
| `description` | Yes | Multi-line description of capabilities |
| `keywords` | Yes | Array of discovery keywords |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools the skill can use |
| `user-invocable` | No | Whether users can invoke directly |

## Using Skills in Agents

When an agent loads a skill, it gains access to:

1. **Code Examples** - Copy-paste ready TypeScript/Python snippets
2. **Tool Definitions** - MCP tool schemas and handlers
3. **Error Handling** - Common errors and recovery strategies
4. **Configuration** - Environment variables and setup

<Steps>
<Step number={1} title="Load the Skill">
The agent reads the SKILL.md file and extracts the relevant documentation.
</Step>
<Step number={2} title="Install Dependencies">
If the skill requires packages, the agent runs the installation commands.
</Step>
<Step number={3} title="Configure Environment">
Set up required environment variables from the skill's configuration section.
</Step>
<Step number={4} title="Execute Operations">
The agent uses code examples as templates to accomplish the user's task.
</Step>
</Steps>
