# Publishing to ClawHub

ClawHub is the community marketplace for AI agent skills. Publish your Starknet skills to share them with other developers and agents.

<Callout type="info" title="Coming Soon">
ClawHub is currently in development. This guide covers the planned publishing workflow and how to prepare your skills for release.
</Callout>

## What is ClawHub?

ClawHub is a registry and discovery platform for agent skills:

- **Browse** thousands of community skills
- **Install** skills with a single command
- **Publish** your own skills
- **Version** and update skills over time
- **Discover** skills by keyword, category, or capability

## Preparing for Publication

Before publishing, ensure your skill meets these requirements:

### Required Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Skill definition with YAML frontmatter |
| `LICENSE` | Open source license (MIT recommended) |
| `README.md` | Human-readable documentation |

### Quality Checklist

<Callout type="tip" title="Quality Standards">
Skills that meet these standards are featured in ClawHub search results.
</Callout>

- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- [ ] Clear, descriptive name and description
- [ ] Relevant keywords for discovery
- [ ] Working code examples for all operations
- [ ] Error handling documentation
- [ ] Configuration reference table
- [ ] Security considerations noted
- [ ] External references and links

## Skill Naming

Choose a descriptive, unique name:

```yaml
# Good names
name: starknet-nft-mint
name: starknet-dao-voting
name: starknet-price-oracle

# Bad names
name: my-skill
name: utils
name: starknet  # Too generic
```

### Naming Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- 1-64 characters
- Must be unique on ClawHub
- Should describe the capability

## Versioning

Skills use semantic versioning (semver):

```yaml
---
name: starknet-nft-mint
version: 1.2.0
---
```

| Version | When to Increment |
|---------|-------------------|
| MAJOR (1.x.x) | Breaking changes to the skill interface |
| MINOR (x.1.x) | New features, backward compatible |
| PATCH (x.x.1) | Bug fixes, documentation updates |

## Publishing Workflow

### 1. Create ClawHub Account

```bash
# Install ClawHub CLI
npm install -g @clawhub/cli

# Login or create account
claw login
```

### 2. Initialize Your Skill

```bash
cd skills/my-skill

# Initialize for publishing
claw init
```

This creates a `claw.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "starknet-nft-mint",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Mint NFTs on Starknet",
  "author": "your-username",
  "repository": "https://github.com/you/starknet-nft-mint",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["starknet", "nft", "mint"],
  "starknet": {
    "networks": ["mainnet", "sepolia"],
    "contracts": []
  }
}
```

### 3. Validate Your Skill

```bash
# Check for issues
claw validate

# Output:
# ✓ SKILL.md found and valid
# ✓ Required fields present
# ✓ Code examples verified
# ✓ Ready to publish
```

### 4. Publish

```bash
# Publish to ClawHub
claw publish

# Output:
# Publishing starknet-nft-mint@1.0.0...
# ✓ Published successfully
# https://clawhub.com/skills/starknet-nft-mint
```

## Updating Skills

When you make changes:

```bash
# Bump version (updates claw.json)
claw version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
claw version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
claw version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

# Publish update
claw publish
```

## Discovery Optimization

Help users find your skill:

### Keywords

Choose specific, relevant keywords:

```yaml
keywords:
  - starknet
  - nft
  - erc721
  - mint
  - collection
  - digital-art
  - ipfs
  - metadata
```

### Description

Write a clear, searchable description:

```yaml
description: >
  Mint NFTs on Starknet ERC-721 collections. Upload metadata
  to IPFS via Pinata, set token URIs, and batch mint multiple
  NFTs. Supports both mainnet and Sepolia testnet.
```

### Categories

Tag your skill with relevant categories:

```json
{
  "categories": ["defi", "nft", "identity", "gaming", "social"]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation Quality

<Steps>
<Step number={1} title="Clear Prerequisites">
List exact package versions and environment requirements.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Complete Examples">
Every operation should have runnable code.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Error Handling">
Document common errors and recovery steps.
</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Security Notes">
