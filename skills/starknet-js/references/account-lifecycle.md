# Account Lifecycle

Use this as a runbook for account creation, usage, and rotation in starknet.js-based agents.

## Lifecycle Stages

1. Provision
Create/signing key material and assign account address.
2. Bootstrap
Fund account and verify deploy state.
3. Active Operations
Execute transactions under explicit policy and monitor nonce/fees.
4. Rotation
Rotate key material or signer backend with overlap window and rollback path.
5. Decommission
Revoke credentials and archive audit artifacts.

## Signing and Sponsorship Boundaries

- Keep signer credentials separate from app credentials.
- For sponsored flows, preflight policy checks before submitting execute calls.
- Enforce max-spend and allowlist constraints at signer or account-policy layer.

## Nonce Management

- Always query current nonce before constructing concurrent transaction batches.
- Use per-workflow request IDs to correlate nonce conflicts and retries.
- On nonce mismatch, refresh state and rebuild calldata instead of blind replay.

## Incident Response

- Suspected key leak: rotate signer immediately and revoke active sessions.
- Persistent reverts: pause automated execution and require manual review.
- RPC consistency failures: switch provider and re-validate chain context.
