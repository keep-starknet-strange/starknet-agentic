# References

Use this directory for deep-dive Starkzap SDK references that should stay out of the main `SKILL.md` flow.

Included starter references:
- `signer-integration.md` - `src/signer/*` behaviors, Privy/Cartridge trust boundaries, auth assumptions.
- `sponsored-transactions.md` - paymaster flow, `feeMode` behavior, deploy+execute edge cases.
- `erc20-helpers.md` - `Amount` semantics, token metadata/presets, transfer and approval patterns.
- `staking-reliability.md` - pool discovery, timeout/abort behavior, membership-sensitive entrypoints.

Keep each reference focused and cross-link back to implementation paths in the Starkzap repo.
