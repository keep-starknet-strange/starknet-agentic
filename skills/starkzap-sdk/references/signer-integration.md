# Signer Integration

This placeholder documents Starkzap signer integration boundaries.

Planned contents:
- `OnboardStrategy.Signer` and `StarkSigner` lifecycle.
- `OnboardStrategy.Privy` server trust model and auth requirements.
- Cartridge runtime constraints and policy scoping.
- Mapping signer failures to `AUTH_OR_PERMISSION` recovery steps.
